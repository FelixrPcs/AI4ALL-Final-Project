# Instagram-Bot-Detector
Over the course of the intense AI4ALL program with Columbia University I created a jupyter notebook that displays my final project. In this final project I loaded in a public dataset, loaded that data into a decision tree algorithm, fit and trained the tree model to approximately 88% accuracy, created bar graphs to visualize important data, created a confusion martix to give a visual of our accuracy, and finally explained the confusion matrix. The tree model takes in different data to predict whether or not a instagram an instagram account is real or fake.
